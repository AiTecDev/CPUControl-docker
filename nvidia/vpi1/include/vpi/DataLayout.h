/** Defines how channels are packed into an image plane element.
 *
 * Packing encodes how many channels the plane element has, and how they
 * are arranged in memory.
 * 
 * Up to 4 channels (denoted by X, Y, Z, W) can be packed into an image
 * plane element, each one occupying a specified number of bits.
 *
 * When two channels are specified one right after the other, they are
 * ordered from most-significant bit to least-significant bit. Words are
 * separated by underscores. For example:
 *
 * X8Y8Z8W8 = a single 32-bit word containing 4 channels, 8 bits each.
 *
 * In little-endian architectures:
 * <pre>
 *      Address  0   ||  1   ||  2   ||  3
 *            WWWWWWWWZZZZZZZZYYYYYYYYXXXXXXXX
 * </pre>
 *
 * In big-endian architectures:
 * <pre>
 *      Address  0   ||  1   ||  2   ||  3
 *            XXXXXXXXYYYYYYYYZZZZZZZZWWWWWWWW
 * </pre>
 *
 * X8_Y8_Z8_W8 = four consecutive 8-bit words, corresponding to 4 channels, 8 bits each.
 *
 * In little-endian architectures:
 * <pre>
 *      Address  0   ||  1   ||  2   ||  3
 *            XXXXXXXXYYYYYYYYZZZZZZZZWWWWWWWW
 * </pre>
 *
 * In big-endian architectures:
 * <pre>
 *      Address  0   ||  1   ||  2   ||  3
 *            XXXXXXXXYYYYYYYYZZZZZZZZWWWWWWWW
 * </pre>
 *
 * In cases where a word is less than 8 bits (e.g., X1 1-bit channel), channels
 * are ordered from LSB to MSB within a word.
 *
 * @note Also note equivalences such as the following:
 * @note In little-endian: X8_Y8_Z8_W8 = W8Z8Y8X8.
 * @note In big-endian: X8_Y8_Z8_W8 = X8Y8Z8W8.
 *
 * Some formats allow different packings when pixels' horizontal coordinate is
 * even or odd. For instance, every pixel of YUV422 packed format contains an Y
 * channel, while only even pixels contain the U channel, and odd pixels contain
 * V channel. Such formats use a double-underscore to separate the even pixels from the odd
 * pixels. The packing just described might be referred to X8_Y8__X8_Z8, where X = luma, 
 * Y = U chroma, Z = V chroma.
