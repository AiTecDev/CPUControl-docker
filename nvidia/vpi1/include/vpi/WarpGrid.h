 * @ingroup VPI_WarpMap
 * This structure defines the layout of the control points in the destination
 * image of a remap operation.
 *
 * The control points are used as the basis for geometric transformation from
 * source image to destination image. The remaining points are transformed
 * based on the interpolation. Thus the density of the control points controls
 * the quality of the geometric transformation.
 *
 * This is an example of defining regions in the image:
 * \code
 *               warp grid width
 *         /                         \
 *        /                           \

 *      *********
 *      *  +  + *-- \
 *      *       *    vertInterval
 *      *  +  + *-- /
 *      *       *
 *      *********
 *         |--|
 *     horizInterval
 *
 * \endcode
 *
 * Here's an example of a WxH dense grid definition:
 * \code
 * VPIWarpGrid grid;
 * grid.numHorizRegions  = 1;
 * grid.numVertRegions   = 1;
 * grid.horizInterval[0] = 1;
 * grid.vertInterval[0]  = 1;
 * grid.regionWidth[0]   = W;
 * grid.regionHeight[0]  = H;
 * \endcode
 *
 * ### Restrictions
 *
 * * numHorizRegions cannot exceed \ref VPI_WARPGRID_MAX_HORIZ_REGIONS_COUNT.
 * * numVertRegions cannot exceed \ref VPI_WARPGRID_MAX_VERT_REGIONS_COUNT.
 * * Intervals must be power-of-two.
 * * Alignment restrictions:
 *   - `regionWidth[0]` to `regionWidth[numHorizRegions-2]` must be
 *     aligned to \ref VPI_WARPGRID_MIN_REGION_WIDTH and at least \ref VPI_WARPGRID_MIN_REGION_WIDTH.
 *   - `regionWidth[numHorizRegions-1]` must be at least \ref VPI_WARPGRID_MIN_REGION_WIDTH.
 *   - `regionHeight[0]` to `regionHeight[numVertRegions-2]` must be
 *     aligned to \ref VPI_WARPGRID_MIN_REGION_HEIGHT and at least \ref VPI_WARPGRID_MIN_REGION_HEIGHT.
 *   - `regionHeight[numVertRegions-1]` must be at least \ref VPI_WARPGRID_MIN_REGION_HEIGHT.
